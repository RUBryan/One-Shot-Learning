Assigned done at Rutgers for Comp Arch (211)
For this assignment, you will write an implementation of a simple machine learning algorithm known as "one-shot learning". Your program will read a set of training data to determine the coefficients for an equation, and then use those coefficients to estimate the results for new data.
Read through the assignment carefully, especially the description of the algorithm. Small, seemingly insignificant changes to the algorithm may result in different answers due to rounding. Note also that the directory layout is different from PA1, as you are writing only one program.
Grade 100/100
